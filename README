SCons++ - Python-scriptable build tool

PREREQUISITES
=============
* Python >= 2.5, < 3.0
* boost >= 1.39
   boost::system
   boost::filesystem
   boost::python
   Boost Graph Library
* SQLite 3
* scons >= 0.98.5

BUILD
=====
Run scons(scons++ can't build itself yet).
If required, location of boost installation can be overrided:
scons boostdir=/usr/local/include/boost-1_39 boostlibdir=/usr/local/lib boost_suffix=-gcc43-mt-1_39

"scons check" will run scons++ ad-hoc regression test suite and compile "Hello,world" program
located in examples/hello with scons++

Whenever run, scons++ will leave graph.dot file in current directory which contains the
dependency graph in Graphviz DOT format. If Graphviz is installed, you can use dot utilty
to massage the .dot file into more appealing form:
dot -Tpng graph.dot > graph.png
